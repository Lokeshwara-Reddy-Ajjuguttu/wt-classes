<center><p>Once there was a hare. He felt very proud because he could run very fast.</p></center>

<center><p>One day, he saw a slow-moving tortoise. The hare laughed at the tortoise and said, "you're moving very fast, shall we have a running race."</p></center>

 <center><p> The tortoise knew that he could not run fast like the hare. He thought, "Why not have some fun? I am not worried about failure. " So he said, " I am ready for the race" and accepted the challenge. The forest friends fixed a day for the race.</p></center>

  <center><p> On the Fixed day, both the hare and the tortoise arrived at the starting point. They had to run up to a big banyan tree, nearly a mile away.  It was really a long distance for the tortoise. The race started. The tortoise began to move forward slowly.  The hare ran at great speed.</p></center>

 <center><p>After running for some time, the hare stopped to take a rest. The tortoise was far behind. "It will take him a long time to catch me", thought the hare. He laid down under a shady tree and soon fell asleep. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving slowly and steadily. On the way, he saw the hare in deep sleep.</p></center>

 <center><p>He continued to move and finally reached the winning point. </p></center>

  <center><p>The hare woke up after some time and began to run fast. But it was too late now. When he reached the end point, he saw the tortoise waiting, with a smiling face. </p></center>

  <center><p>The hare hung his face in shame. </p></center>
